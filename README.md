# Arduino-BMS-monitor-1-cabin

This is my script for my arduino battery monitor display on my sailing boat which is fed by CANBUS from BMS.

5 pages are cycled with the click of a single button on cabin version and 3 on helm version.

- Analogue style Voltage Displayed *
- Analogue style Amperage Displayed *
- Main page: Watt reading, battery endurance and charge time and battery, charging, overload and message indicators.
- Bars page: Displaying battery parameters
- Information page: Displaying relay status, battery temperature, Charge and Discharge limits and error flags.

* Only on cabin version

Medium long button press changes display brightness.

Long press sends clearing BMS faults over CANBUS.

Hardware and changelog listed in script.
